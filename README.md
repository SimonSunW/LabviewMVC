#LabviewMVC
==========

An extensible HMVC implementation in LabVIEW

##Why we care
The idea of separating the UI from the bussines logic is not new (MVC its been around for a while)
...




##How To Use it
The plan is to use VIPM to deliver the framework and the user will only need to create the application part and create childs of the 3 classes and override the required Methods. (this has not been verified)

The second option is to clone/download the framework and have on the side of your application.




##How is implemented



###MODEL
The model is only a placeholde class that has been included in the controller private data.
The user should create a child class to implement their own code.


###VIEW



###CONTROLLER
